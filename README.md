# Stock-Prediction-SVM

Abstract: 
This semester, I want to use Supervised learning to predict the stock markets’ price points. I will use an API to request current stock data, and then train the machine to predict the stocks’ values. My hope is that with this project, I will be able to correctly buy and sell stocks due to the predictions with low risk. 

Required Skills: Machine Learning will be relatively new to me, so using it in this manner will help me increase my knowledge of it. I will need to find a good API which could bring me accurate data quickly. The required python3 libraries: Matplot.lib, numpy, pandas, and sklearn. Sklearn has many tools for machine learning, and one of these is SVM, which will be our primary form of machine learning.  

Project description: 
I am going to use machine learning on the data of a single stock. Using the closing cost to predict trends, I will use supervised learning to analyze the data and predict prices in the future. I will not use the opening, and any other values to train the system. The popular algorithms used include Support Vector Machine (SVM) and reinforcement learning, showing promise in tracing the stock market and keeping risk low . The first steps I will take will be getting data via the API. After the data is retrieved, I must visualize and manipulate the data in order to be used in Machine Learning. Setting up the machine learning and then visualizing the predictions made with graphs is the final thing to do. After using the SVM, I will be able to test whether the predictions were correct, and if SVM is a viable method of predicting stock values. The paper I read confirmed a ~70% correct prediction rate (1), so I will see if I can achieve that or even higher.
